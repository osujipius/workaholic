    question: "Do I need a good CV to land a job?",
    answer:
      "Yes, Having a CV is the only way you can be noticed by employers. If you do not have a CV how would employers know that you have the skills and the ability to do the job? Of course, you cannot go around telling employers that you are a good fit without a CV. A good CV will attract employers that will invite you for a job interview, and then who knows you may just land the job. When you create a good CV, you will be on your way to a job interview in no time. In conclusion, a CV highlights why you are the best person for the job.",
